Order Batching problem:

In manual order picking systems, order pickers walk or drive through a distribution warehouse (ref.file "Traversal.png") in order to collect items which are requested by (internal or external) customers. In order to perform these operations effciently, it is usually required that customer orders are combined into (more substantial) picking orders (Batch)  of limited size. The Order Batching Problem deals with the question of how a given set of customer orders should be combined such that the total length of all tours is minimized which are necessary to collect all items.

The code doesn't work as well and i need some feedback to improve it.
